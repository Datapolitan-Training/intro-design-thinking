<!-- start of A block -->
# Welcome
???
+ Facilitators and TA introduce themselves, establishing mastery but also creating openings for vulnerability and awareness

---

# A Few Ground Rules
???
+ Facilitators establish the intention we have for the culture of the classroom

--

+ Step up, step back
--

+ Keep yourself muted during instruction
--

+ Be curious and ask questions in the chat box
--

+ Assume noble regard and positive intent
--

+ Respect multiple perspectives 
--

+ Be present (phone, email, social media, etc.)

---

# What to Expect Today

???
+ An opportunity to set expectations about the topics covered today

--

+ Explore key elements of design thinking
--

+ Practice mapping out the analytics process

---

# Housekeeping
???
+ Facilitator sets expectations with the students
+ Establishes the "contract" for the class

--

+ We will take a 10 minute break halfway through the workshop
--

+ If you need to take a break, turn off your video camera for privacy
--

+ Questions in the chat box
--

+ Raise your hand if you need help

---

# Getting Started
--

+ We're going to give you 2 minutes to think through several questions
--

+ Come up with as many responses to the prompt as you can -> **quantity not quality**
--

+ We'll pair you up to introduce yourself and share your responses
--

+ You will introduce your partner as we share

---

# Getting Started
--

1. What do you know about design thinking?
--

2. What are your questions about design thinking? 

---

# Breakout Rooms
???
+ prep for how breakout rooms work

--

+ We will be working in breakout rooms throughout this workshop
--

---

# Introductions/Sharing

+ Who is your partner?
+ What key fact did they have?
+ What key question did they have?

???
+ An opportunity for participants to get to know each other and settle into the class
+ We bring them into a positive space related to their work
+ Facilitator reminds them the data isn't the end but the means to achieve the actions that make us feel good about our jobs

---

# Reflection
--

+ What are the patterns/themes that you see in these questions and answers?
--

+ Do we have answers to the questions asked?
--

+ What do we still need answers to?

---

# Wrap-Up
--

+ What did you notice about this process?
--

+ What made this process successful? 
--

+ What made this process challenging?
--

+ What do you think is next?

# 10 Min Break

---

# Process Mapping
--

+ Allows you to identify and strategize for key steps in your analysis
--

+ Helps sequence tasks and identify gaps in understanding
--

+ Provides a basis for documenting work
---

# Process Mapping

???
+ Facilitator does the "I do" phase by describing a past project that was mapped out

# How to Create a Process Map
???
+ Facilitator introduces the method for creating a process map. The language is still in flux. Find the language that is most authentic to your understanding that resonates with the students
--

![img-right-30](images/ideate_discuss_decide_crop.png)
+ Identify the key challenge or question
--

+ Identify the outcome
--

+ Identify key way to validate the outcome (outputs)<br>
--
_**How do we know we've got it right?**_

---

# Outcomes vs Outputs
--

+ Outcomes are the larger benefits and/or achievements you're trying to realize<br>
--
 (happiness, health, well-being, etc.)
--

+ Outputs are the tangible parts of your outcome<br>
--
 (survey responses, measured results, etc.)
--

+ Outputs enable us to find outcomes
--

+ Without outcomes, there is no need for outputs

# How to Create a Process Map
![img-right-30](images/ideate_discuss_decide_crop.png)
+ Identify the key challenge
+ Identify the outcome
+ Identify key way to validate the outcome (outputs)<br>_**How do we know we've got it right?**_
--

+ Identify the key inputs (data, partners, supplies, finances, etc.)
--

+ Sequence the key questions to turn inputs into outputs

---

# Key Tips
--

![img-right-30](images/ideate_discuss_decide_crop.png)
+ Place each step on a Post-It Note

#### &nbsp;

# Key Tips
![img-right-30](images/ideate_discuss_decide_crop.png)
+ Place each step on a Post-It Note
+ Order and reorder as necessary
--

+ Some steps will need to be broken down


???
+ Facilitator identifies the key parts of the process based on the graphic presented
+ Faciliator reminds participants to follow the process that works best for them

---

# Using Design Thinking
--

+ Key Question: How do we incorporate design thinking into this class? 
--

+ Identify the outcome
--

+ Identify the outcome measures (outputs)
--

+ Identify the key inputs
--

+ Sequence the key steps to move from inputs to outputs


???
+ The more involved "We do" phase where we do this together

# The Data Analytics Value Chain

![img-center-80](images/valuechain.png)

---

# What did you notice about this process?
???
+ Facilitator reflects on the exercise and what participants are taking away from the experience
--

+ Knowing the problem and sequencing the steps can be harder than working with data
--

+ Having these answers can make the analysis much easier
--

+ This is a process you can do with any challenge, no matter how big
--

+ Everyone has something to add, no matter how technical (or non-technical) they are
